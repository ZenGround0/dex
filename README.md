# dex
A dex library separated out from go-ipfs.  This is being built specifically to address the needs of ipfs-cluster, particularly the ongoing effort to [ingest and shard large files using this tool](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/278).

Perhaps this will eventually be used more broadly or merged with upcoming efforts to support many data formats for importing to IPFS's unixfs IPLD format.
